Graduation is a time honored tradition at UW dating back to the first graduate in 1876. Before husky stadium and thousands of departmental graduations, it was a simple affair of meeting on the steps of Denny Hall. Depicted in this June 1920 commencement issue of the Daily we see a glorious parade of graduates passing by many of the landmarks that make the UW 100 years ago so special.
