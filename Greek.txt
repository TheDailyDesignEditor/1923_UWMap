This is what you would have seen from the top of the chimes tower. From this viewpoint you are looking out onto 45th St. and 18th Ave, and can see newly built homes that would have housed professors and students. Greek row as we know it today was only just being established and many of the frat houses of this period did not survive and were rebuilt in the 1950s and 60s. One thing to note in this photo is the lack of trees around the houses, many early Seattle neighborhoods were completely gutted of the original forests with only small yards that surrounded the house.
