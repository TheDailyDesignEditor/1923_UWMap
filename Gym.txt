Completed in 1927, the women’s gymnasium replaced a space built in 1896 and was built in tandem with Hec Ed. Before the IMA, students used this space's many gyms and pools to exercise and fulfill their physical education requirements. The building would survive as a gymnasium until the 1990s where it would be taken over by the School of Drama and renamed to Hutchinson Hall. Interestingly the pool wouldn’t be filled until 2011, but many remnants remain of its history as a gym through paintings that hang in some of the studio spaces.
