Before housing the Scandinavian studies department, Raitt hall had many hats to wear. Being built in 1916 in the newly ingratiate Liberal Arts Quadrangle, it was originally called the home economics building and housed said department as well as most famously the Daily’s original newsroom. Unlike the current newsroom, it was open-air with a collection of tables, mis-matched chairs, clacking typewriters, and a small sign near the entrance that read “Journalism Hall”.
