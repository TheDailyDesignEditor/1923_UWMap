One of the most famous UW presidents because of his association with one of the most famous buildings on campus. Henry Suzzallo became president of the UW in 1915 after teaching sociology at Columbia and Stanford. Under his tenure at UW he would be involved in matters of the student body, especially the school's entry into World War One. Following that conflict he would help to push forward the construction of a central research library. Though it would open in 1926, because of a dispute over the length of the work day for loggers with then Governor Roland Hartley, he would replace over half of the members of the board of regents. Who would fire Suzzallo and replace him with UWâ€™s next president Matthew Lyle Spencer. Sadly he would die only a few years later in 1933, and the library would be named in his honor.
