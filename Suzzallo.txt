Only a twinkle in the university's eye in 1923, construction would begin on a permanent space for the UW’s growing library collections. Being housed in many different places over the years, a “library" would first be placed in Denny Hall, eventually moving over to the Washington Museum built for the AYP Exposition in 1909. Finally with the completion of this library in 1926 it would become the “Jewel of the University”, a title in which it and the world famous reading room would hold to this day. Original plans for the library included two wings and a tower, but due to major expenses incurred to build the reading room, only one wing would be completed.
