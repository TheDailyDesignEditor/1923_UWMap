The Chimes Tower was a beacon that could be seen from miles away when it was first built in 1904. Originally serving as a water tower next to the Theodore Jacobson Observatory, it would be converted to a chimes tower in 1914 with the donation by then editor of the Seattle Times Col. A.J. Blethan of said bells. It would provide a great lookout onto the newly developing greek row and Union Bay, it would sadly burn down in 1949.
